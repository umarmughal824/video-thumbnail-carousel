I used following technologies for it.

PHP to show data dynamically from the api
API LINK: https://demo2697834.mockable.io/movies

To get the api JSON response, I used CURL php library.

Except that
From Frontend I used following technologies

HTML DOM
HTML/HTML5
CSS/CSS3
JAVASCRIPT
JQUERY 
JSON

For previously whatched I videos, I used recent term.
For recent term I used 
HTM5 API "STORAGE".

From Storage API, I used Session Storage.
So no MySql is involved here.
